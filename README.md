# Voice-to-Image-Gen

## Generate Images Using Your Voice

This code uses the DeepAI API and Gradio to generate images from your voice. It uses the Whisper transcription model to transcribe your audio into text, and then uses the DALL-E model to generate an image based on that text.

## How to use

- Run the code using gradio.launch().
- Speak into your microphone to generate an image.
- The generated image will be displayed in the output window.

## Requirements

- OpenAI API key (register for free on the DeepAI website)
- gradio,openai installed (pip install gradio)

## Note

- This code requires a good internet connection to function.
- The generated image may not be perfect, as the models are still in development.
- Please check the DeepAI API documentation for usage limits and terms of service.
